### Jeebs Rapid Application Development

My primary project is [Jeebs](https://github.com/bencgreen/jeebs), a series of .NET 5.0 libraries written in C# to help develop applications quickly.

### Docker Ecosystem

Alongside that I also maintain an [ecosystem](https://github.com/bencgreen/docker) of Docker images which I use for almost all my web hosting.
